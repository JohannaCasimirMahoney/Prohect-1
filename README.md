# Overview

J.A.F. Automotive is an interactive tool where the user can enter specific key words in the search bar generating the nearest auto repair shop / mechanics in the area based on GPS signal.

The motivation behind the development is to save time and make it more convenient and hassle. As a user it is important to find a shop / mechanic expert based on top ratings generated through the application.

In addition, the user should have the capability to add the make, model, and year of the car to narrow down the search. The MAPQUEST API allows the application to display the satellite view for upcoming traffic and road blocks in the area.
